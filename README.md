Stopwatch

Implementation of a stopwatch in Python


This program was developed as part of an assignment for Rice University's 
course Interactive Programming in Python. Due to it being developed on 
an online platform, it might not run in every Python IDE. Therefore, 
the easiest way to run this program is to access this link[1] and click Run.

This is an implementantion of a classic stopwatch, with an incorporated game.
Each time the Stop button is pressed on a whole second, the score increases.
The numbers in the top right corner represent the score / number of tries.
The Reset button resets both the score and the timer.
